# Haulers Guide #
#### A written guide to hauling in EVE Online
<br>  

## About this project
>This is an attempt at documenting what I learn as I progress as a hauler in EVE Online so that hopefully it will help others looking for the same information.  
Hauling is somewhat of a niche profession and it can be difficult to find information that is detailed, exhaustive and friendly to newcomers of the game.
>
>I do not claim to be some sort of expert. I'm simply learning as I go and documenting some of it here for my own use and hopefully some of you will find it useful as well.
