## T1 Industrials

Industrial ships are the starting haulers that all new pilots created after September 2015 can fly.  
They are very easy to blow up and should not be used for hauling expensive cargo.  
They will let you slowly start your career as a Space Trucker though!

The following T1 industrials are available in the game with the ones in bold being the defacto standards:

* **Bestower (Amarr)**
* Sigil (Amarr)
* **Badger (Caldari)**
* Tayra (Caldari)
* Epithal (Gallente)
* **Iteron Mark V (Gallente)**
* Kryos (Gallente)
* Miasmos (Gallente)
* Nereus (Gallente)
* Hoarder (Minmatar)
* **Mammoth (Minmatar)**
* Wreathe (Minmatar)
