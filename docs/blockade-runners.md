## Blockade Runners

Blockade Runners are transport ships that can carry small sized cargo but they are very fast and they can warp while cloaked by having a Covert Ops Cloaking Device equipped.

The following Blockade Runners are available in the game:

* Prorator (Amarr)
* Crane (Caldari)
* Viator (Gallente)
* Prowler (Minmatar)

### Fitting

**TODO**

<br>

### Collateral

This is a tough one. Assuming you do everything correctly and you have fitted the BR with a speed fit, you are very difficult to catch.  
However, you have such a tiny tank that many ships are able to kill you in just their first shot.

Can't really give much advice on this other than give it go, get a feel for it and then accept whatever collateral you feel comfortable with.

### Low Sec

BRs can be alright to ship smaller cargo into low sec with.  
Just make sure you are fitting for a minimal align time and you hit that cloak every time.
