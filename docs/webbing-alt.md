## Webbing alt
A webbing alt is a character on a different account than your hauler that is used to put webs on your freighter in order to get it to move into warp faster.

**NOTE: You do not need a webbing alt, but it makes trips faster and safer.**

A freighter can take almost a minute to jump into warp leaving plenty of time for a gang of gankers to get on you, but by utilizing some clever use of game mechanics we can reduce this to 2-3 seconds.

### How it works
To achieve warp a ship needs to align and reach 75% of its maximum velocity.
A webifier reduces a ships maximum velocity, thereby making it reach 75% of that velocity much faster.

You need to be logged on to both accounts at the same time.  

In order to be able to web your hauler without becoming a criminal you need to either duel it or be in the same corporation. That corporation also needs to have **Friendly Fire** set to **Legal**.

Steps:
1. Jump your webbing alt through the gate. Scout and make sure it looks safe.
2. Align your webbing alt to break cloak, then immediately stop the ship (ctrl+space).
   Alternatively (depending on your webbing range) approach the gate to be in the middle.
3. Jump through the gate with your freighter. Make sure you're within range of your webbers.
4. Preload your webifiers on your alt by holding ctrl and clicking the modules.
5. Start to warp your freighter to the next destination.
6. Alt+tab back to your alt and as soon as your freighter becomes visible in the overview, click it.  
If you preloaded your webifiers this will both target and start webbing your freighter.

If you don't have proper range for your webs (60km+) then you might have to approach your freighter before you are able to web it.  
Using ships with bonus to webifiers is therefor recommended.

Another way of guaranteeing that you're within range is to join a fleet with your webber and hauler, then warp off with your webber as it is likely going to be through the gate way before your hauler.  
Then once your hauler is through and invisible, you go on your webbing alt and in the fleet window you chose **Warp to member**.

### Ships to use

Hyena  
Daredevil  
Rapier

### Fitting the ship

The important thing here is having the webifiers and signal amplifiers for fast lock time and long range.
Having a bit of a tank on top of that is great, but the important thing is getting your freighter webbed.

3x Stasis Webifier II  
or
3x Federation Navy Stasis Webifier

These have a 60% velocity bonus. Lower ones might work but at a slightly higher risk of failure.

2x Sentient Signal Amplifier
1x Damage Control II

2x Small Core Defense Field Extender
