## Contract alt

A contract alt is used by some haulers to accept contracts for primarily two reasons.

1. To accept a contract without letting the issuer of the contract know who the pilot is.  
   This provides a layer of protection against gank setups.

2. To have a character in a hauling corporation that can get wardecced and be able to accept contracts for that corporation while leaving their hauling pilot in an NPC corporation that's not War Eligable.


If you're just hauling on your own then there is absolutely no need for a contracting alt unless you're suspicious of the contract and its issuer, in which case you might want to avoid the contract instead.
