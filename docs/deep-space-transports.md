## Deep Space Transports

Deep Space Transport ships are the daily drivers for most haulers and I would say that it's when you start flying a DST that you will see the money start to come in in a steady stream.

DSTs are popular because they can carry up to 62,500m3 (with **Transport Ships V** trained) and fit a very high tank, i.e effective hp, for their size.

#### Training Time

Training into DSTs takes a minimum of about 30 days with an additional 6 days to get **Transport Ships** to level 4.


#### The Fleet Hangar
DSTs are a little special in that they have a small regular cargohold but a fairly big Fleet Hangar.  
The cargo capacity of the Fleet Hangar scales not with fittings but with your **Transport Ships** skill.

Most haulers only bother with training **Transports Ships** up to level 4, and therefor most DST contracts stay below 60,000m3.

### Fittings

### Collateral

If you have a tanky fit and you can perform a consistently perfect Claok + MWD trick in your sleep then you can fairly safely ship any collateral you feel comfortable with in a DST.

### DSTs and Low Sec

Some DST pilots do shipments to low sec systems in their DSTs.  
If you decide to do this you need to be aware that the cost of ganking you is zero. A single frigate can kill you if you're unlucky.

Therefor, should you decide you want to ship to low sec and you're carrying a somewhat valuable load, I would recommend using another character to scout ahead of you.

Also use that character to create bookmarks to insta dock and undock on the station you're going to.
