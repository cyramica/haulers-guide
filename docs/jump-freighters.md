## Jump Freighters
Jump Freighters are the most advanced haulers in the game and take the most time to train into.  
A Jump Freighters don't have to use regular jump gates and can instead jump to any low or null system, within range of their current system, where a **Cynosural Field** (cyno) has been lit.


## Cyno alt
In order for Jump Freighters to jump to a destination a cyno must have been lit there.  
Because of that, JF pilots make use of a cyno alt that goes to a station in that system in order to light a cyno so that the Jump Freighter can jump directly to a station and dock up.
