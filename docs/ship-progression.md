## Ship progression

### T1 Industrial
If you're an entirely new player you'll likely start out in a newbie frigate that was handed to you by the game and quickly progress to what's refered to as a T1 Industrial hauler.

These are not very good for doing actual contracts though as they have a limited cargo hold and and are paper thin so they get blown up easily.

But they serve their role as a starting point for new players and are what you'll likely get into at first.

### Sunesis

The Sunesis is not really a hauling ship. It has a fairly small cargo hold, it looks like some kind of Cylon attack ship and it doesn't quite lend itself very well to the fantasy of being a space trucker.  
However, it requires minimum skills and can be fitted for instant warp while still carrying around a 1K mÂ³.  
That means it's much safer to fly than a T1 hauler for a new player.

Here's a fit that even an alpha account can fly:

```

### Deep Space Transport and Blockade Runner

DSTs and BRs have the same skill requirements which is why I've put them in the same tier here, but they fulfill very different roles.  

A Deep Space Transport ship with Transport Ships trained to level 4 will allow you to do the vast majority of public contracts that get posted to the Haulers Channel and should be what you work towards getting into as fast as possible.

A Blockade Runner can be useful in certain situations, but it's not really necessary to get one from a hauler investment point of view unless you find yourself going back and forth a lot with limited cargo.

In short, go for a DST first and don't bother with the BR until you really feel the need for one.

### Freighter

Freighters are the large cargo ships that we usually think of when we think of hauling. The Emma Mersks of Space.  
Training to be able to fly one takes quite a while though, and training to fly one properly takes even longer.

A freighter costs roughtly 1-1.5 billion ISK to purchase

You do not need a [webbing alt](webbing-alt.md) to fly one, but it is recommended as jumping into warp can take upwards a minute without one and around 3 seconds with one.

Having a freighter is awesome, but you'll probably still find that you spend most of your time in a Deep Space Transport unless you start working for a freight corporation such as Red Frog or PushX.

### Jump Freighter

Jump Freighters are the most advanced haulers out there.  
They allow you to haul freight to low- and null sec by jumping from one station directly to another through the use of a Cynosural Field Beacon.

Because of their reliance on beacons, it is necessary to have a [Cyno alt](cyno-alt.md) if you want to work as a Jump Freighter pilot.

Training into flying a Jump Freighter takes about 130 days and once you can fly it they cost around 10-15 billion ISK to purchase from the market.

Because of their high price, Jump Freighters are not used to haul in between high sec systems where they would be reliant on going through regular jumpgates and therefor be easy targets for gankers.

Flying Jump Freighters can be very lucrative and many JF pilots don't even bother to undock for less than 200 mil.
