## Freighters

Freighters are capital ships made for hauling large sized cargos through high security space.  
The drawback is that they're really slow, both in aligning and during warp.  
The align time can be overcome by using a [webbing alt](docs/webbing-alt.md) though.

The following Freighters are available in the game:

* Providence (Amarr)
* Charon (Caldari)
* Obelisk (Gallente)
* Fenrir (Minmatar)

### Fittings, Cargo sizes and EHP

For high collateral, use Reinforced Bulkheads II.  
For large cargo sizes, use Expanded Cargoholds II.  
For very short trips back and forth, inartial stabilizers and nanite plating.

### Collateral

The general recommendation is to never haul more than about 1 billion ISK in a Freighter.

If you're using a webbing alt you could go up to 2 billion, which is the maximum most Freight companies will allow for a normal contract.
